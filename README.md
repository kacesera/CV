## KC Thomas

I am a curious, ambitious, energetic wonderer and wanderer. After spending some time traveling and learning about the world; living lives as an ESL teacher and Inbound Digital Marketer–– I have settled into a new role that I only ever dreamt was possible: I am a **Full Stack Software Developer**, with interests ranging on everything from finance to music. 

Pushing boundaries, experimenting, and testing are some of my favourite things. It doesn't take much to get me excited about a project!

Over the past year, I wrote my own Sudoku Game, taught myself Ruby with App Academy's Online program, and am now on track to graduate Makers Academy (a 16 week Software Development Bootcamp) in December 2020. Being in tech wasn't my first path, given my history in Theatre, English, and Marketing–– however, tech does something that no other field can: It makes me excited about the future in a time when the future is so uncertain.

| **Something else worked on** | A webapp to do y. | Ruby              |

## Skills

Let's face it: I'm an extrovert. I am one-hundred-percent, inequivocally a people-person. I wake up on a Monday morning, and I'm **that** person. You know, the one who's actually excited for the 9AM Zoom call–– and my strongest skills are a great reflection of this. That said, am I someone who has to fill the silence? Not at all. Being comfortable with silence in a conversation, particularly over video conferencing, is an integral component of excellent communication and active listening.

#### Effective, Efficient Communication & Active Listening

Listening is generally far more important than speaking–– such as listening to what you're clients are truly trying to communicate, and forming a response from there. Not only does the client feel more understood, doing this saves quite a lot of time.

Having had the opportunity to work directly with stakeholders on various marketing projects, I was able to demonstrate on a daily basis in addition to coordinating our fully remote team of social media managers.

#### Design, Imagination, & Looking at the Big Picture

It's easy to get lost in the details of things. As a matter of fact, I used to do that a lot. The most important lesson I've learnt in life (and in the creation of any project) is to look a the big picture. Sure, the small details matter–– however, the first priority is to construct the foundation. Give the idea shape before etching in the filigree.

When I'm not coding, I'm constantly creating in one way or another: by painting, making music, writing plays, or writing down new ideas. Creating, in general, all starts with a macro-mindset.

#### Quick Learner & Teaching

When I first began my studies at University, I was on track to become a Theatre Educator, and because of this–– I was required to learn about meta-learning, or rather: Learning how to learn. This is a concept I've since been incorporating into my every day life as much as possible. Back in 2018, taking a look at my choice to travel the world, while being fluent in only one language (English)–– I decided to incorporate my knowledge of meta-learning into a couple of my own self-directed endeavours: Learning French, and learning to play the piano.

After 5 months of intense self-study and weekly conversations in the language, I had managed to learn French to an A2 level, and was far more confident speaking in French than I had ever been in Spanish (despite 5 years of classes). 

This technique or mindset has helped greatly in allowing me to learn bits and pieces of other languages, including coding languages, such as Ruby.

#### Improvement Mindset

"What can I do to make this a better experience?" Is something I constantly think about. Perfect doesn't exist, but I like to work on projects and develop them to be as useful as possible.

As part of the Makers Academy precourse, I was tasked with a 'Student Directory' project. As part of this project, I decided to go slightly beyond the scope of the walkthrough to include a few new parameters that would deliver a more effective directory, and a better user experience. However, in order to implement some of these new methods.

While doing this, I ran into more than a few bugs, but was able to fix all of them, refactor the code, and deliver a working program in commandline. All-in-all, I'm extremely happy with how it turned out. Rather than only taking a name and a month for the student, my directory takes in a name (properly capitalized it), a month, a hobby, and a birthdate (in UK format), and then returns each student by their respective cohort, and numbers each student within each cohort.

Was creating this necessary? No. I could have created a simple directory that lists out each student and cohort. However, when imagining that I was building this for a teacher (like myself at the time), I knew that more information and a more descriptive output was necessary for a great experience.
